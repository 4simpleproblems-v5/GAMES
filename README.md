# 4SP Games
#### The official repository for 4simpleproblems' game collection. This includes GN-Math, StrongdogXP (Thanks Josh), GTA 1 in both a fan-made version and the JS-DOS version, Eaglercraft in original or WASM format, and the original DOOM.
----

#### This has been made possible by forking the StrongdogXP repository, hooking Firebase to it, reformatting the URL directories to work into a sub-repository, to remake the CSS and HTML, to update the authentication system, to find, reformat, and add games to this collection, and add custom categories (Like the Others Category)
----
#### This version is special because it compiles all of the categories into one index.html file. No play/index.html redirect needed, all games a few clicks away. This collection of games also unloads the game images once the game player is opened, giving faster preformance at no cost. If you want to host 4SP for yourself, you can contact me on discord at @foursimpleproblems.
